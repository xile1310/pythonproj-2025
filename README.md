# üìß Simple Phishing Email Detector
A lightweight **rule-based phishing email detector** built with Streamlit.
It classifies emails as **Safe** or **Phishing** based on configurable rules such as domain whitelists, suspicious keywords, edit distance checks, and URL heuristics.

# How it works?
- Domain check ‚Üí penalty if sender not in whitelist
- Keyword check ‚Üí weighted score for suspicious keywords in subject/body
- Edit distance check ‚Üí catch lookalike domains (e.g., paypa1.com)
- Suspicious URL check ‚Üí IP-based links, user@host links, claimed-domain mismatch

Final classification:
- Safe if score ‚â§ 4
- Phishing if score > 4
Rules and thresholds are customizable by config.json

1. Run the Web App
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Evaluate on Dataset
```
python3 evaluate.py --data-dir dataset --out results.csv
```
```yaml
  Example Output:
  === Evaluation Report ===
  Dataset: dataset  |  Total: 4198 (ham=2801, phish=1397)
  Accuracy : 0.7273
  Confusion Matrix  TP=270  FP=18  FN=1127  TN=2783
```

# Configuaration
config.json stores your rules for whitelist domain and keywords.
```json
{
  "legit_domains": ["google.com", "paypal.com", "redhat.com", "singapore.tech.edu.sg"],
  "keywords": ["account", "click", "password", "urgent", "verify"]
}

```
